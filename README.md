This project leverages BERT, a powerful transformer-based language model, to detect phishing URLs with high accuracy. Traditional feature-based and heuristic approaches often struggle to identify sophisticated or novel phishing attempts. By fine-tuning BERT specifically on labeled phishing and benign URLs, this model can capture subtle patterns that distinguish malicious links from legitimate ones.
Key Features:
Utilizes pre-trained BERT for robust phishing URL classification
Fine-tuned on diverse, real-world datasets of phishing and benign URLs
Outperforms traditional methods in generalization and detection accuracy
Easily extensible for additional security use-cases, such as email or SMS phishing detection
